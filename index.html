      <p class="fdesc">
      I ain't so good at making all these kinda write-ups so whatever you're about to read just take it that wayüòú.So... I was
      once that stereotypical idiot, who often taught that Theresa girls where 'weird' people and shii like that, you know but with Chiemelie around, i decided to go along
      with him in his campaign against stereotypes and stuff, and really get to know this group of people I
      found myself around. Thenü§î, I stumbled upon a particular girl, who I felt I should get know more than the
      the rest. Quite a nice girl actually,one who I see as sage and who is quite intriguing too, posessing this
      crazy personality, second to none. The adventurous and wild-ish type, not too classy and not too outgoing too.
      On this day which is your birthday, Dabby, I just want to wish you the best of luck in all your future
      endeavors in the life that you will lead on. Don't you dare let anyone change the beautiful persona that you
      have and keep educating people in the positive, just like you have done to me in the past. I acknowledge your
      annual aging with this little present of mine. Wishing you many more years and a Happy Birthday, that's as gorgeous and as funny as you are. HBD Small Woman</p>
